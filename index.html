                    Gayah Karmo born 1996 and still doing my thing. Born in Monrovia, Liberia and migrated here with my family December of 1999, and even though I did not have much say in that decision, it has definately the most impactful one in my life. Throughout my life I have been blessed enough 
                    to have the best supporting cast around me that anyone growing up in a foriegn land 
                    would dream to have. This supporting cast starts with my parents, whom since I can remember is 
                    always pulling a double shifts multiple times a week or coming home to grab a bite 
                    before heading off to a second job. It wasn't only the hard work they exhitbited and 
                    instilled in my brothers and I, but also the displine, confindence, self-love, and respect and love  
                    for others that developed my second tier of support, my brothers.g my thing.
